# Course Project

## Objectives

This course project runs throughout the semester. Through this project you will reach two objectives

* Build a full stack data center network on your own laptop ranging from topology, routing, to applications.
* You will get hands-on experiences of the major concepts learnt in lectures and understand the tradeoffs of different design decisions

## Project Outline

### Project 1: Get Started with Line/Circle Topologies

### Project 2: FatTree Topology

### Project 3: Routing ECMP and Application Placement

### Project 4: Measurementproject4/README.md

### Project 5: Failure Recovery and ARP Table

### Project 6: Flowlet-based Load Balancing

### Project 7: Congestion Aware Load Balancing

### Project 8: Software load balancer

### Project 9: Add a new feature to the system

## Notes

### Late policy
You should submit your work on an assignment (electronically) before its due time. All assignments will be due at 11:59pm on their selected days. 

If you submit your work late, we will award you a fraction of the score you would have earned on the assignments had it been turned in on time, according to this sliding scale:

* 90% for work submitted up to 24 hours late
* 80% for work submitted up to 2 days late
* 70% for work submitted up to 3 days late
* 60% for work submitted up to 5 days late
* 50% for work submitted after 5 days late

For example, if you should have earned 8/10 points but submitted 36 hours late, you will instead earn 6.4 points.

That said, you are allowed **SIX free late days** during the semester. The final project is due based on the final grade submission date and cannot be turned in late. You do not need to tell us that you are applying your "late day" -- we'll remove the late penalty at the end of the semester from the assignment(s) that benefits you the most.

 Please plan your work on the assignments so that travel, interviews, athletics, touring, student clubs, extracurricular activities, religious holidays, etc. do not cause you to submit it late. None of the above reasons nor a heavy academic workload constitute an extraordinary circumstance.

 Many projects depend on earlier projects. *So even if you miss a deadline of a previous project, it is still important to finish it so you can build future projects on top of it.*

### Collaboration policy
Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process. Individuals must reach their own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its solution. During this time, you are encouraged to discuss your project with other students at the conceptual level. However, when the time comes to write the code that solves the problem, the program must be your own work.

Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's program, comments, README description, or any part of the submitted assignment. This includes character-by-character transliteration of another works (whether inspected visually or copied digitally), but it also includes derivative works (i.e., by renaming variable names or subtly shifting around statements in order to try to hide that copying has occurred). You are also not allowed to use other people's code, comments, or results. This includes work done by other students this or past semesters, as well as any other code you find online.

You are also responsible for ensuring that the code you write for the assignments is not readable by others, which includes sharing with students in future years or posting publicly on websites like github.

You may possibly reuse functions from libraries, but you must check any packages/libraries that you plan to use with the TAâ€™s. You should also mark on all the places where you reuse functions/libraries from other places. 

All programs will be subject to automated checking for similarity. Any cases of plagiarism will result in an F for the entire course. If you have any questions about policies about academic integrity, please talk to the professor.
